"""Deterministic per-player, per-market prop projection model.

Pure math, no I/O: given a player's rolling usage/efficiency (from
``features.build_player_week``), his team's rolling pass/rush volume (from
``features.build_team_week``), and the opponent's rolling defense-vs-role
factor (from ``features.build_opp_pos_def``), produce a projected
distribution for one market and read off P(over)/P(under) a line.

    expected volume     = team rolling volume x player's rolling usage share
                           x game-script multiplier (trailing teams pass more,
                           leading teams run more -- see ``game_script_multipliers``,
                           which wraps ``nflvalue.montecarlo.simulate``)
    expected efficiency = player's rolling efficiency x opponent-vs-role factor
    mean                = expected volume x expected efficiency
    sd                  = supplied by the caller (see note below) or a
                          reasonable default; the distribution is then read
                          off for p_over/p_under.

Everything here is deterministic and seeded where randomness is used (Monte
Carlo game-script only) -- same inputs always produce the same outputs, so
this can run inside a walk-forward backtest with the LLM layer completely
absent (PHASE1_HANDSOFF_DESIGN.md H6: the LLM never touches a number).

A note on SD: per-market residual dispersion is a property of HISTORICAL
ACCURACY (how far projections tend to miss by), not of a single player-week,
so it belongs to whoever is running many predictions and can measure
residuals walk-forward (``prop_backtest.py`` does this and passes ``sd``
in). A conservative default is used here only as a fallback so the function
never crashes with no dispersion info.
