"""Drive-by-drive Monte Carlo game simulator.

Given two teams' power ratings (points off/def) and league priors, we simulate a
game thousands of times, one possession at a time, scoring touchdowns (6-8),
field goals (3), and the occasional defensive score. Summing real integer scores
reproduces the spiky NFL margin distribution (the pushes on 3 and 7 that a smooth
bell curve misses), which matters for spreads and totals.

From the simulated score distribution we read off:
    P(home win), P(home covers a spread), P(over a total), and percentiles.

Uses numpy for speed (a backtest runs ~1,400 games x thousands of sims). If numpy
isn't installed, the rest of the app still works — MC features just switch off.
