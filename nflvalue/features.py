"""Walk-forward player & opponent feature tables from play-by-play.

Builds two tables (see ``nflvalue/db.py`` for schema):

* ``player_week``   -- one row per (season, week, player) with this week's
                       ACTUALS plus rolling, PRIOR-WEEKS-ONLY usage/efficiency
                       features derived from that player's own history.
* ``opp_pos_def``   -- one row per (season, week, defteam, role) with rolling,
                       PRIOR-WEEKS-ONLY yards/EPA allowed to that role,
                       expressed as a factor relative to the league average
                       (1.0 = average defense).

LEAKAGE RULE (the #1 kill bug per PHASE1_HANDSOFF_DESIGN.md): every ``roll_*``
column is computed by sorting each group by (season, week), then calling
``.shift(1)`` BEFORE the rolling/expanding window, so the value attached to
row (season, week) only ever aggregates rows strictly earlier in that
player's/team's own sorted sequence. Season boundaries are not reset -- a
player's week-1 rolling features come from the END of the prior season,
which is intentional (real prior information, not leakage) and mirrors how
`build_ratings.py` carries ratings across season boundaries.

Position (Phase 1B update): real positions now come from `nflreadpy`'s
weekly rosters (`nflvalue/sources/rosters.py`) -- QB/RB/WR/TE per (season,
week, player), not inferred. This replaces Phase 1A's role-inference
heuristic (which could only bucket a coarse QB/RB/REC from play-by-play
participation and couldn't split WR from TE). The old heuristic is KEPT as a
fallback for the rare row where a player is missing from that week's roster
snapshot (e.g. a same-day practice-squad elevation); those rows are tagged
`position_source="inferred_fallback"` so they stay visible/flaggable rather
than silently passing as equally reliable.
