"""Forward CLV (closing-line-value) log -- the ONLY honest edge test on free data.

PROP_SHORTLISTER_SPEC.md §5: with no historical prop-line data, "does the
model beat the price" can only be measured forward: log every published lean
with the price at entry, log the last snapshot before kickoff as the
approximate CLOSE, and track whether our entries systematically beat the
close. Positive average CLV is the accepted proxy for real edge; a lean
record without CLV is just a story.

Probabilities are compared in DE-VIGGED space (consensus across the books in
the snapshot), so a book fattening its margin can't masquerade as line
movement. ``anytime_td`` is quoted one-sided (Yes only), so its "prob" is the
RAW implied probability -- vig included at both entry and close, so the
DIFFERENCE is still meaningful; rows carry ``prob_kind`` so nobody mistakes
one for the other.

Close is approximate by design (last pre-kickoff snapshot, however old).
``close_ts`` is stored so staleness is always visible.
