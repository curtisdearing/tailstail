"""Real player positions, free (nflreadpy `load_rosters_weekly`).

Phase 1 Sub-phase A inferred a coarse QB/RB/REC role bucket from play-by-play
participation because the free PBP has no position column. That's a real
limitation: it can't split WR from TE, and it's an approximation of "position"
built from performance data. `load_rosters_weekly` gives the real thing --
each player's actual listed position, per (season, week, team), no inference
needed. This module fetches and caches that table.

This is NOT load-bearing the way live weekly injuries/inactives are (Phase
1B Part 2) -- roster position for HISTORICAL weeks is stable, factual, and
doesn't change after the fact, so caching it to parquet (like
`historical_pbp.parquet`) is safe and avoids re-hitting the network on every
run. A small recorded fixture (real rows, not synthetic) is shipped for
offline/deterministic tests.
