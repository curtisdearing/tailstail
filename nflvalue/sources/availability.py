"""Availability resolver: who is actually playing, and who absorbs the usage.

PHASE1_HANDSOFF_DESIGN.md H1/H2: the nflverse injury feed is DEAD (2025+),
so ESPN's undocumented endpoints are the only free injury source, and true
availability isn't known until ~90 minutes before kickoff. This module
implements both clocks:

    clock="wed"   -- Wednesday provisional: league-wide team-injuries feed
                     (Out/Doubtful/Questionable) -> OK | RISK | OUT
    clock="t90"   -- pre-kick final: per-event competitor roster ``active``
                     flag OVERRIDES the Wednesday read (inactive -> OUT).
                     This feed's population time is not guaranteed (the
                     single riskiest link in the chain) -- callers must gate
                     it through nflvalue.freshness rather than trusting it.

Every resolved status carries {source, timestamp, matched_by} so nothing is
asserted without provenance. ESPN rows are matched to nflverse gsis ids by
normalized name + team; UNMATCHED rows are returned separately, never
silently dropped or guessed (H3: fail loud).

Usage reallocation (H8) estimates, from historical with/without splits, how a
team's usage shifts when a player sits. When no absent-week sample exists the
estimate is an explicitly-flagged proportional guess (low_confidence=True) --
the honest answer is "we don't know, here's a weak prior," not a made-up split.
