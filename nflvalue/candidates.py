"""Enumerate every eligible player-market prop candidate for a week's games.

For a given (season, week) this module walks the slate from
``historical/historical_lines.parquet`` (the nflverse schedules table, which
carries pre-game consensus spread/total -- legitimate prior information, not
leakage) and produces one candidate per (player, market) with the Phase-1
projection contract attached:

    candidate = projection.project(...) + {game_id, matchup, team, defteam,
                line, line_source, prices?, spread_line, total_line}

Guardrails baked in:
  * FEATURES ARE STRICTLY PRIOR-WEEK. Rows come from ``features.py``'s
    walk-forward tables; the roll_* values attached to (season, week) only
    aggregate weeks < week (tested by tests/test_leakage.py).
  * Candidate SET for a completed historical week follows the
    ``prop_backtest.py`` convention: players with a ``player_week`` row that
    week (i.e., who actually recorded usage). For LIVE weeks the pipeline
    instead passes ``roster_mode="carry_forward"`` which enumerates from the
    most recent prior week per team -- no week-W information at all -- and
    lets the availability resolver (Phase 1B) trim it.
  * Cold-start gate: only ``eligible_for_shortlist`` players (Phase 1B
    MIN_GAMES_ELIGIBLE) plus a configurable minimum-usage floor, so scrubs
    never reach the ranker.
  * SD comes from walk-forward residuals of the SAME projection engine over
    weeks strictly before the target week (per market) -- never from the
    target week's outcomes.
  * LINE: a real prop line (Phase 3, per-event Odds API pull) when supplied;
    otherwise a SYNTHETIC line (the player's own trailing mean, floor+0.5)
    tagged ``line_source="synthetic_trailing_mean"`` so no consumer can
    mistake it for a market price. Synthetic lines carry no prices, so the
    edge component stays ``no_market`` (PROP_SHORTLISTER_SPEC.md §3).
