"""The #1 kill bug test (PHASE1_HANDSOFF_DESIGN.md): a feature attached to
row (season, week) must never change when data from (season, week) or later
is removed from the input. If it does, some rolling/expanding computation is
reading data it shouldn't be able to see yet.

Method: build each feature table on the full fixture, then again after
deleting every play at-or-after a cutoff week. Rows strictly before the
cutoff must be byte-for-byte identical between the two builds.
